The current code working for the project is the one stored in KheraassCurrent
It is a version that uses print statements to simulate motor output
The code used in this project is intended for use with an Adafruit motor board, with all libraries and modules included
However the boards module, checks whether the board is installed, as it is not, this throws errors

The code for the motor kit, is commented out and a clean version with the code included is in
KheraassWithHardware
